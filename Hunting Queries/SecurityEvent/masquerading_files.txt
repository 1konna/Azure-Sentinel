// Name: masquerading files.

// Description: Malware writers often use windows system process names for their malicious process names to make them blend 
// in with other legitimate commands that the Windows system executes.
// An analyst can create a simple query looking for a process named svchost.exe. 
// It is recommended to filter out well-known security identifiers (SIDs) that are used to launch the legitimate svchost.exe process. 
// The query also filters out the legitimate locations from which svchost.exe is launched.
