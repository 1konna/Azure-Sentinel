// Name: sharepoint downloads from devices associated with previously unseen user agents.
//
// Description: tracking via user agent is one way to differentiate between types of connecting device. 
// In homogeneous enterprise environments the user agent associated with an attacker device may stand out as unusual. 
// In stable environments such connections by new IPs may be unauthorized, especially if associated with spikes in volume
// which could be associated with large-scale document exfiltration.

// Data source: OfficeActivity

// Techniques: #Exfiltration
